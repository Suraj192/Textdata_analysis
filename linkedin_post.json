This calls for collaboration between the policy-makers and industry players, academics, and NGOs. We were therefore excited to host Frans Timmermans (Executive Vice-President in charge of the Green Deal and European Commissioner for Climate Action) at our Innovation Centre in Sickla, Sweden, where we discussed and explained how we can make renewable battery parts from a tree, with a product called Lignode. This is a concrete example of how renewable materials are, and can be, used to bring the highest possible value to society and our stakeholders. We also invited NGO's, other industry players, and academics to a roundtable for a conversation to find common ground and solutions as a path forwards.

    "text": "Making a change into more sustainable options in food packaging while keeping all of the performance can be difficult. Therefore, we are proud to now present the PureFiber Guard tray, which has up to 90% less plastic than traditional plastic trays, yet keeping 100% of the functionality!  According to our LCA study, the new trays have 70% lower CO2 impact compared to fossil plastic (Polypropylene, PP).  It is a natural food tray made from wood fibers with a dash of protective barrier to handle even the creamiest foods. The PureFiber Guard trays are produced in an eco-friendly way in the Nordics, designed for circularity and are easily recyclable in the paper stream in most of Europe. One of the clear benefits the tray offers for brand owners is reduction in environmental fees charged for single use plastic items.Learn more: https://hubs.li/Q016Y89Z0#formedfiber #storaenso #foodpackaging #fastfoodpackaging #sustainability",

    "text": "Stora Enso and Picadeli, Europe’s leading take-away salad bar company, are introducing renewable formed fiber lids to replace single-use plastics in take-away packaging. The lids are made of PureFiber™ by Stora Enso, and they are plastic-free, recyclable, and biodegradable. The innovation will help Picadeli reduce approximately 120 tonnes of plastic waste annually!“Our strategic aim is to grow with sustainable, scalable, and innovative packaging solutions. We do this by supporting strong forerunner brands such as Picadeli in meeting the growing consumer demand for plastic-free and circular solutions. A salad bowl lid is a good example of an everyday single-use plastic item that can make an important difference on climate footprint when replaced by a sustainable alternative,” says Sohrab Kazemahvazi, SVP Formed Fiber at Stora Enso.Read more: https://hubs.li/Q014K0Ll0",

In our latest podcast episode, we look at the differing views on single-use and multi-use, with a special focus on food service items, such as paper cups. A recent Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study by the European Paper Packaging Association (EPPA) is at the heart of the discussion.

Yet much of this waste could be reduced with proper packaging. For example, ensuring that the food packaging has the ability to withstand moisture or drastic temperature changes is important, as this improves the shelf life of products and thereby reduces waste.Learn more about how we work together with our customers to create renewable and fully circular food packaging, with less food waste, improved food safety, and a positive environmental impact: https://hubs.li/Q011wxfh0#reducefoodwaste #sustainablepackaging #recyclability",

    "text": "Paperboard material used for producing paper cups requires a barrier – commonly made from plastic – that offers both protection against liquid and functionality in converting. UltraThinPE Tec™ is a new innovation from Stora Enso that significantly reduces the share of plastic coating in food service board (FSB) and in applications such as single-use paper cups. With the help of UltraThinPE Tec™, Stora Enso has developed the thinnest polymer coating for FSB products on the market. This achievement allows for paper cup designs with less than 5% plastic – an important step in helping packaging converters, brand-owners, and retailers meet their plastics reduction targets.The technology is presently used in the production of UltraThinPE coatings for Stora Enso’s Cupforma product range for paper cups.

    "text": "When heating food in conventional ovens, board materials need a PET coating to provide heat resistance and food protection. Meeting the threshold of 10% PET plastic will be an important step in producing trays with better recycling properties ♻️ which is the case with our new development in the low-carbon range for ready meals Trayforma. The new Trayforma PET34 material has a significantly reduced amount of fossil-based barrier materials, enabling brand owners and retailers to switch from fully fossil-based materials to renewables. Trayforma is now also available in 420gsm for producing larger and sturdier microwave and conventional oven trays. Read more: https://hubs.li/H0_FCQG0#reducingplastics #foodpackaging #lowcarbon",

This will be a significant benefit for our customers sustainability efforts - in a very concrete way. 🍃Earlier this year, we announced that our Oulu site was successfully converted from paper production to high-quality kraftliner production for packaging. Overall, Stora Enso is committed to driving the net-positive future and is aiming to reduce absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of scopes 1, 2, and 3 by 50% by 2030 from the 2019 base-year (aligned with the 1.5-degree scenario). As a part of our investment in Oulu, we directed EUR 40 million toward enhancing the site’s environmental performance.The new converted line conversion has been operational since January and is producing AvantForte kraftliner since the spring. AvantForte is a premium fresh fibre-based kraftliner with superior durability and visual appearance for applications such as wet and fatty foods, and high-end e-commerce.

We participated in the development of WBCSD – World Business Council for Sustainable Development's new report \"Forest Sector Net-Zero Roadmap\" where exactly this was investigated. Annika Bresky, our President and CEO and member of WBCSD’s Executive Committee highlighted that “The forest sector has the opportunity to become climate and nature positive. But the forest sector alone cannot bring to market the solutions the world needs to transition to a net-zero and nature-positive economy. It will require concerted and collaborative action across the full value chains and with investors, civil society and governments.”Access the report here: https://hubs.li/H0_0nwP0  #COP26 #wbcsd #sustainableforestry #netzeroeconomy",

That was one of the questions raised in a a panel discussion on “Transforming the Food Systems – the Role of Food Processing Technology and Packaging Solutions in the Net Zero Age”, hosted by Tetra Pak at the World Climate Summit in Glasgow, an official side event of the COP26. Our Head of Sustainability, Annette Stube attended the panel.\"Our renewable low-carbon food packaging is essential part of decarbonizing the food system. We have just stepped-up our climate commitments. By adopting a regenerative stance, we are shifting our focus to becoming a net positive contributor and to develop our business within the planetary boundaries,\" says Stube.To be able to do this, we need to:💚 Ensure that packaging and materials are fit for the future and designed to deliver as little footprint as possible over the whole value chain💚 We should look at and understand the whole systems we are part of and make them work for a sustainable future for everyone.You can listen to the panel discussion here: https://hubs.li/H0-Ng2Q0#COP26 #sustainability #foodpackaging",

    "text": "Stora Enso’s Packaging Materials’ growth journey is moving forward, as we are investing EUR 97 million to expand the board production at the Skoghall site in Sweden. The investment is expected to be completed in the second half of 2023.At the same time, following the successful conversion in Oulu from paper to kraftliner production for food applications, Stora Enso has decided to initiate a pre-feasibility study to convert the second, idle paper line into a packaging board line.“The investment strengthens Stora Enso’s capability to produce high-quality and cost-competitive consumer board grades within the growing core segments of liquid and food packaging. In Oulu, the ramp-up of the first converted production line has been successfully executed, reaching towards full capacity, quality requirements as well as profitability ahead of plan. Through both these growth initiatives we are demonstrating speedy time-to-market and ability to respond to the increasing demand for more sustainable packaging,” says Hannu Kasurinen, EVP Stora Enso’s Packaging Materials division.Read more: https://hubs.li/H0ZJSwN0",

    "text": "“Technology can support us in taking the next steps in occupational safety and will bring a competitive advantage,” says Wolf Willems, Head of Safety at Stora Enso. This is perhaps more relevant than ever, with Covid-19 challenging the regular safety procedures. One example of new ways of working is replacing physical safety audits with digital ones. Live-stream mill tours make the audits easy to execute, as the only necessary equipment are a 3G internet connection, a selfie-stick, and a headset. In addition, Stora Enso units have explored live-stream safety walks where participants from different countries virtually walk through a mill and discuss findings. Virtual reality is also being tested for safety training.Read more about how we work with safety in the Annual Report: https://hubs.li/H0S7jcL0",

    "text": "Commuting by bicycle is growing in popularity as more city dwellers  choose this healthy and sustainable mode of transport. How can cities invest in sustainability and support the growing bicycle community? One example can be found in the student city of Uppsala, Sweden, where a two-storey bicycle garage was built next to the railway station using cross-laminated timber by Stora Enso. The building can accommodate up to 1200 bicycles and makes it easy for commuters to travel sustainability and park their bicycle in a safe, well-lit space that's conveniently located right next to the platform.
